          Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its
          simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various applications
          and can be integrated with other technologies.
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python includes a standard library of modules, such as os, datetime,
          and math, and provides a core set of language elements like loops,
          conditionals, and functions. Python can be extended for specific
          purposes by importing additional modules or libraries:

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

        <ul class="main-ul">

            A general understanding of programming concepts and logic.

      <section id="Python_and_Java" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Python and Java</header>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python and Java share some similarities but have fundamental
          differences. Python is dynamically typed and does not require explicit
          type declarations, unlike Java, which has static typing and strong
          type checking.
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          While Python and Java share some syntax and control flow constructs,
          Python follows its own dynamic paradigm and uses a more flexible,
          prototype-based object model compared to Java's class-based model.
          Python supports functions as first-class citizens and does not require
          explicit access modifiers like Java (public, private, protected).
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python promotes a more free-form and concise coding style compared to
          Java. You don't need to declare all variables, classes, or methods
          explicitly, and Python's case sensitivity allows for more flexible
          naming conventions.
        </p>

      <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Hello World</header>
        <p class="main-paragraph">Let's write your first Python code!</p>

        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
   def say_hello(your_name):
 print("Hello, " + your_name)

      say_hello("World")
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p class="main-paragraph">The output of this code is Hello, World</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Variables</header>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Variables in Python are used to store and reference values in your
          programs. Python identifiers must start with a letter, underscore (_),
          or dollar sign ($), followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python is case-sensitive, so it distinguishes between uppercase and
          lowercase letters in variable names.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Declaring_Variables" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Declaring Variables</header>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          In Python, you can declare variables without explicitly specifying
          their data types. Variable names are case-sensitive, and you can
          assign values to variables using the equal sign (=).
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Here's how you can declare and initialize variables in Python:
        </p>

        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
 #Integer variable
    my_integer = 42

 #Float variable
    my_float = 3.14

  #String variable
    my_string = "Hello, Python!"

  #Boolean variable
    is_python_fun = True
          </pre>
        </code>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python also supports multiple assignments in a single line, making it
          convenient to assign values to multiple variables simultaneously:
        </p>

        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
  x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
          </pre>
        </code>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          This is helpful for when you need to declare multiple variables of the
          same type at once.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Conditional_Statements" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Conditional Statements</header>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your Python
          programs. You can use the if, elif (short for "else if"), and else
          keywords to control the flow of your code based on conditions.
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Here's an example of an if statement in Python:
        </p>

        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
  x = 10

  if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
  elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
  else:
    print("x is less than 5")
          </pre>
        </code>

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          You can use logical operators such as and, or, and not to combine
          conditions in more complex ways. Conditional statements are
          fundamental for creating decision-making logic in your Python
          programs.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Loops</header>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Python supports various types of loops, including for loops and while
          loops. Here's an example of a for loop that iterates through a list of
          numbers and prints each number:
        </p>
        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  for num in numbers:
       print(num)
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          And here's an example of a while loop that counts from 1 to 5:
        </p>
        <code class="code-example">
          <pre>
  count = 1

  while count &lt;= 5:
          print(count)
    count += 1
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          These are just a few examples to get you started with Python. Python
          offers a wide range of features and libraries for various programming
          tasks, making it a powerful and versatile language.
